Safely and easily manage your website's HTTP redirects.

== Description ==

Easily and safely manage your site's redirects the WordPress way. There are many redirect plugins available. Most of them store redirects in the options table or in custom tables. Most of them provide tons of unnecessary options. Some of them have serious performance implications (404 error logging). cleancoded Redirect URL stores redirects as Custom Post Types. This makes your data portable and your website scalable. cleancoded Redirect URL is built to handle enterprise level traffic and is used on major publishing websites. The plugin comes with only what you need following the WordPress mantra, decisions not options. Actions and filters make the plugin very extensible.
